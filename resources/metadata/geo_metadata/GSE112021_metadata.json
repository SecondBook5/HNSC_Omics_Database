            "Chromatin alterations mediate mutations and gene expression changes in cancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has been utilized to study genome-wide chromatin structure in human cancer cell lines, yet numerous technical challenges limit comparable analyses in primary tumors. Here we have developed a new whole-genome analytic pipeline to optimize ChIP-Seq protocols on patient-derived xenografts from human papillomavirus-related (HPV+) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) samples. We further associated chromatin aberrations with gene expression changes from a larger cohort of the tumor and normal samples with RNA-Seq data. We detect differential histone enrichment associated with tumor-specific gene expression variation, sites of HPV integration in the human genome, and HPV-associated histone enrichment sites upstream of cancer driver genes, which play central roles in cancer-associated pathways. These comprehensive analyses enable unprecedented characterization of the complex network of molecular changes resulting from chromatin alterations that drive HPV-related tumorigenesis."
