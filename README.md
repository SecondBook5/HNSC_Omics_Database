# HNSC Multi-Omics Database Project

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to the development of a **Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSC) Multi-Omics Database**. The project aims to integrate multi-omics data, including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and other datasets, to facilitate the analysis of tumor biology and therapeutic targets. The database will support personalized therapy development, such as Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs), by providing researchers access to cross-omics data, helping identify biomarkers and gene-protein interactions.

## Key Objectives
- **Metadata Collection**: Acquiring metadata from various sources, including GEO, TCGA, and CPTAC.
- **Schema Design**: Designing a flexible database schema to accommodate structured and semi-structured data.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizing PostgreSQL and MongoDB for structured and semi-structured data management.
- **Future Expansion**: Support for machine learning models and advanced visualizations for systems biology insights.

## Current Status
We are currently in the **metadata collection phase**. Initial sources include datasets from GEO, TCGA, and CPTAC.

### Features
- Integration of multi-omics data.
- Data querying and visualization for gene expression, protein abundance, and mutations.
- Initial analysis pipelines for ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, and other data types.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- Python 3.x
- R
- Jupyter Notebook or RStudio
- PostgreSQL and MongoDB (for future database integration)

### Installing Dependencies

To install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For R dependencies, the packages will be managed within the relevant scripts.
