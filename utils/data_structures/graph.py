This module provides a Graph class to represent directed and undirected graphs using
adjacency lists. It supports fundamental graph operations, including adding vertices
and edges, performing graph traversals, detecting cycles, and exporting/importing
the graph structure to/from JSON and CSV files.

Key Classes and Functionality:

1. GraphVertexError and GraphEdgeError:
   - Custom exceptions to handle specific errors related to invalid vertex or edge
     operations within the graph.

2. Vertex Class:
   - Represents a vertex within the graph, storing its ID and associated edges.
   - This class maintains an edge list, supporting weighted and unweighted edges.

3. Edge Class:
   - Represents a directed edge between two vertices in the graph, with an optional
     weight attribute.
   - This class is used to structure edges as objects, enabling easy management and
     traversal.

4. Graph Class:
   - Core class that models the graph, supporting both directed and undirected graphs.
   - It stores vertices in an adjacency list format, where each vertex ID points to
     its associated Vertex object.
   - Graph creation is flexible, allowing options to enable/disable self-loops,
     duplicate edges, and directionality.

Key Methods in the Graph Class:

- add_vertex(vertex_id: str) -> None:
  Adds a unique vertex to the graph. Raises an error if the vertex ID is empty or invalid.

- add_edge(start_vertex: str, end_vertex: str, weight: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
  Adds an edge from start_vertex to end_vertex. Supports weights and manages reverse
  edges automatically in undirected graphs. Validates vertices and edge constraints.

- has_edge(start_vertex: str, end_vertex: str) -> bool:
  Checks if an edge exists between two specified vertices.

- bfs(start_vertex: str) -> List[str]:
  Performs a Breadth-First Search traversal from the given start vertex, visiting each
  connected node layer by layer.

- dfs(start_vertex: str) -> List[str]:
  Performs a Depth-First Search traversal, exploring each path to its end before
  backtracking.

- detect_cycle() -> bool:
  Uses DFS to detect cycles in the graph. Identifies both simple and complex cycles
  and supports directed/undirected graph configurations.

- export_to_json(file_path: str) -> None:
  Exports the graph structure to a JSON file, making it compatible for data exchange
  or storage.

- import_from_json(file_path: str) -> None:
  Imports a graph structure from a JSON file, reconstructing vertices and edges.

- export_to_csv(file_path: str) -> None:
  Exports the graph structure to a CSV file, where each row represents an edge.

- import_from_csv(file_path: str) -> None:
  Imports a graph structure from a CSV file, rebuilding the graph.

Notes on Error Handling and Edge Cases:
- Extensive error handling is implemented, ensuring that invalid inputs (e.g.,
  non-string vertex IDs, nonexistent vertices for edges) are managed gracefully.
- Optional configurations (allow_self_loops, allow_duplicate_edges) provide flexibility
  and ensure that constraints are enforced based on the graphâ€™s purpose.
- Defensive programming techniques are applied, logging warnings or errors when
  operations are misconfigured or constraints are violated.

Usage:
This module can be used to represent, manipulate, and analyze graphs across
various applications, from simple traversals to complex network structures.
